1. Create a view in the test database to make it easier to generate a recurring report.

2. Write a view named low_sales which lists the salesmen, their regions, and their sales from lowest to highest, who had less than $12000 in sales. Remember, a saleman's sales is an aggregation of transactions.

3. Copy the statements and their returns to an ASCII text file named Lab8 and attach the file.


CREATE VIEW low_sales AS

SELECT sman_fname AS name, region, SUM(sales) AS total
FROM sales JOIN salesman USING(salesman_id)
GROUP BY name, region HAVING total < 12000 ORDER BY total;


SELECT * FROM low_sales;
+------+--------+----------+
| name | region | total    |
+------+--------+----------+
| rick | north  | 10064.00 |
| barb | north  | 11850.00 |
